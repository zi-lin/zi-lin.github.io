This is the draft I wrote for my presentation for the course called **English Lexicoiogy**, where I was asked to introduce something about Chinese morphology to student from College of Foreign Languages.

Chinese morphology, or rather, Chinese word-formation is quite different from English for it has less derivation. Also, parataxis plays a vital role in the process of word building. You can click [here](http://zi-lin.com/pdf/introduction-chinese-morphology.pdf) to get access to my draft.
