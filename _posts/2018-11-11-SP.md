# Introduction
In fact, "semantic parsing" is, ironically, a semantically ambiguous term, which could refer to:

- Semantic role labeling (also known as shallow semantic parsing, see previous post for more information).
- Finding generic relations in text.
- Transforming a natrual language sentence into its meaning representation.

In this post, semantic parsing is the task of mapping natrual language sentences (NL) into complete **formal meaning representation** (MRs) which a computer can execute for some domain -specific application [^1]. Representing the meaning of natural language is ultimately a difficult philosophical question and many attempts have been made to define generic formal semantics of natural language, including:

- **Meaning Representation Language (MRL):** MRL is designed by the creator of the application to suit the application's needs independent of natural language. Some MRL data sets are based on Prolog database.

- **SQL Query**

- **Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)**

- **Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS)**

- **Universal Dependency (UD)**
