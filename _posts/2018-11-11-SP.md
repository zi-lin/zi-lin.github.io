# Introduction
In fact, "semantic parsing" is, ironically, a semantically ambiguous term, which could refer to:

- Semantic role labeling (also known as shallow semantic parsing, see previous post for more information).
- Finding generic relations in text.
- Transforming a natrual language sentence into its meaning representation.

In this post, semantic parsing is the task of mapping natrual language sentences (NL) into complete **formal meaning representation** (MRs) which a computer can execute for some domain -specific application [^1]. Representing the meaning of natural language is ultimately a difficult philosophical question and many attempts have been made to define generic formal semantics of natural language, including:

- **Meaning Representation Language (MRL):** MRL is designed by the creator of the application to suit the application's needs independent of natural language. Some MRL data sets are based on Prolog database.

- **SQL Query**

- **Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)**

- **Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS)**

- **Universal Dependency (UD)**

# Abstract Meaning Representation

Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) [^2] is a semantic formalism in which the meaning of a sentence is encoded as a rooted, directed, acyclic graph. Nodes represent concepts, and labeled directed graph edges represent the relationships between them. For example, for the sentence "the boy wants to believe the girl" we can have the corresponding AMR graph (in penman format) as:

```
(w / want-01
	:ARG0 (b / boy)
	:ARG1 (b2 / believe-01
		:ARG0 (g / girl)
		:ARG1 b))
```

AMR parsing, the task of transforming a sentence into its AMR graph, is a challenging task as it requires the parser to learn to predict not only concepts, which consist of **predicates**, **lemmas**, **named entites**, **wiki-links** and **co-references**, but also a large number of **relation types** based on the semantic role in PropBank (see the previous blog [Semantic Role Labeling](../SRL/) if you are interested).

## Data
There are multiple version of AMR data, including:
- **LDC2013E117:** 10,853 sentences with 13,050 AMRs (corpus includes multiple annotations for some sentences)
- **[LDC2014T12](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014T12) (AMR 1.0):** 13,051 sentences.
- **LDC2015E86:** 19,572 sentences. This version includes more AMRs, wikification, AMR adoption of new unfied PropBank frames, AMR deepening, automatic AMR-English alignments, and correction of AMR annotation errors.
- **LDC2016E25:** 39,260 sentences.
- **[LDC2017T10](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2017T10) (AMR 2.0):** 39,260 sentences.

## Experiment

These are the AMR parsing results on LDC2014T12, LDC2015E86 and LDC2017T10 test sets, where 2014N refers to the newswire section of LDC2014T12. You should look the original paper if you are intersted in the model. **Please contact me (through email) if the statistics is incorrect.**
