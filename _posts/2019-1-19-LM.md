# Introduction
A statistical language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words or characters. A language model consists of a finite set \\( \mathcal{V} \\), and a function \\( p(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \\) such that:

- For any \\( \langle  x_1 ... x_n \rangle \in \mathcal{V}^{\dagger}\\), \\( p(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \\), where \\( \mathcal{V}^{\dagger} = \mathcal{V} \cup \\{ STOP \\} \\).
- In addition,

\\[ \sum_{\langle  x_1 ... x_n \rangle \in \mathcal{V}^{\dagger}} p(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = 1\\]

Language modeling is the task of predicting the next word or character in a sentence, and that is to estimate the parameters of the model:

\\[ P(X_n = x_n \mid X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, ..., X_{n-1} = x_{n-1})\\]
