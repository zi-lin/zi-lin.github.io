          <p>After spending a year at Google I decided to write this summary for the AI residency program at Google during this endless quarantine period. I hope this can serve as an insight for someone who is interested in this program and looking for more details about it.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-google-ai-residency-program-pros-and-cons">What is Google AI Residency Program: Pros and Cons</h1>

<p>If you have never heard of this program but are interested in finding a position to gain research experience in machine learning, you should at first check the <a href="https://research.google/careers/ai-residency/">official website</a> where you can find most of the general information. Of course, there are other companies having similar AI residency programs which you can also give a try. As many previous AI residency have introduced thoroughly before, I would give a very brief overview here from my own experience.</p>

<p>Perhaps many people would ask what’s the difference between doing research as a residency and as a grad student. A very obvious but critical one is about time. At undergrad school, I and many of my peers think it would be a great honour to be admitted to top grad schools, but we never think about whether it is because we enjoy doing research so we apply to grad school or we want to be admitted so we do research. I bet someone still did not figure it out even when he or she has become a PhD candidate. However, it is you yourself who is going to devote the next five or more years into this journey, and it is all about doing research, so before you dive into that long run, AI residency could serve as a trial which provides considerable support and timeline for you to complete solid and well-executed research. Though short in time, this trial will not be discounted for that you are supervised by researchers and targeting on publishing at top-tier conferences, which generally has no difference with the life of PhD.</p>

<p>Another related topic is doing research in academia versus in the industry. As we know this is an endless debate, and one can never get a satisfactory answer based on the experience of others, yet there are still some easy-to-find factors nowadays. First, the biggest advantage for Google is about resources, which really matters especially for AI research. For most of the time you don’t have to worry about computation resources if you want to train a giant model on large-scale datasets. The infrastructure at Google has tried their best to save your energy and time launching jobs, doing hyperparameter search and debugging, which we should admit is really appealing. Second, Google is not only a big company regarding products, but also a big one regarding research. As for NLP, the most widely used models like Transformer or BERT are proposed by Google teams, meaning that Google has already shown solid foundations in frontier research when compared with academia. Getting involved in AI residency means you are not simply following them but can possibly be part of them. Finally, someone has been worried about wasting time doing trivial work, as research projects at Google often involve many people and multi-corporation.</p>

<p>Now let’s talk about some of the concerns you might need to know about. AI residency does not secure you the position as a full-time employee.</p>

<h1 id="applying-to-google-ai-residency">Applying to Google AI Residency</h1>

<p>Once you are seriously considering applying for this, do not forget to check the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vQPiZGZ0w9J2NuXCVpMovzJmoUpMqfM9ZjiYuhh2ZtVu2Zp8Q6t90MJVlTL668vg1jquMuDcFYKoRYB/pub#kix.guzvict3el9j">FAQ pages</a> for more details regarding completing the application.</p>

<p>Then you would realize that actually the application is almost the same as a grad school application where you need to submit your resume (CV), cover letter (SoP), transcript and recommendation letter. It is noted that though the SoP for AI residency and grad schools could be the same in actual content, you should change the story style a little bit to make it a great fit to the program. <a href="https://colinraffel.com/blog/writing-a-google-ai-residency-cover-letter.html">This article</a> provides valuable tips and tricks to help you understand this point. Anyway, from my perspective, it’s a good idea if you submit your grad school and AI residency application at the same time to save efforts and their deadlines are actually very close.</p>
